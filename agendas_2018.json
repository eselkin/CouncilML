SCADA is an automated computer control system for remotely monitoring, operating, and storing data for a process. Currently, SCADA exists for City water and wastewater facilities, but the component systems are disparate, unstandardized, and isolated from one another. Centralization and standardization of potable and wastewater system hardware and software is necessary to enhance operational and reporting efficiencies of the City\u2019s water systems. The City has established a goal of complete water self-sufficiency by the year 2020 achieved by the combined effects of water conservation, advance treated water reclamation, and increased storm water reuse, though this goal is also reliant on the efficient deployment and operation of current and future water resources. Modern SCADA provides diagnostics and user-friendly means of controlling plant processes to help achieve optimal plant performance and operational decision-making. At this time, staff recommends executing an agreement with Vertech Industrial Systems, LLC (Vertech) to complete a comprehensive survey of the City\u2019s SCADA system, develop a SCADA Master Plan, establish and implement system standards for modern SCADA, and provide maintenance and on-call system support. The contract would be for an amount not to exceed $560,750 (including 10% contingency) over a five-year period.", "Background", "The City\u2019s water production, treatment, and distribution system consists of over 250 miles of pipeline, the Arcadia and Charnock water treatment facilities, four reservoirs, ten wells, a wastewater collection system of over 150 miles of pipeline, the Moss Avenue Pumping Station (MAPS), the Santa Monica Urban Runoff Recycling Facility (SMURRF), two sewer flow monitoring stations, and five remote urban runoff diversions to sewer. These facilities are located both in the City and the City of Los Angeles. From the 1990\u2019s through the early 2000\u2019s, the City\u2019s water and wastewater telemetering and remote control systems were limited in their abilities to control many of the critical operating functions and monitored only basic functions such as reservoir and wet well levels, pump speeds, and intrusion alarms. On September 16, 2008 (Attachment A), Council authorized a contract to provide SCADA system design and improvements for the MAPS and SMURRF facilities to enhance operational efficiencies for the two sites. This included purchase of the required hardware and software for SCADA system implementation at the facilities.", "On July 27, 2010 (Attachment B), Council authorized a contract to purchase and integrate additional hardware and software for SCADA at Water and Wastewater facilities. Council later authorized extension of this contract on September 24, 2013 (Attachment C). The work performed under these contracts improved process efficiency by adding limited remote site monitoring from the Arcadia Water Treatment Facility and integrating water and wastewater systems onto a common SCADA software platform. However, communication with remote sites via unreliable telemetering systems still remains inconsistent, control abilities remain limited, and process graphical representation is outdated. If not addressed, these limitations could hinder implementation of two major initiatives, the Clean Beaches Initiative (CBI) and the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Project (SWIP), which require enhanced system control and functionality, including robust monitoring and forecasting tools for system optimization.", "Discussion", "Accurate and timely reading and recording of water and wastewater facility data is crucial to operating the systems effectively. As the City\u2019s SCADA system exists today, its graphics do not present data to operators according to present-day International Society of Automation (ISA) standards for Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). Use of high-performance HMI enables operators to monitor and keep systems running at optimal levels and allows them to foresee treatment plant upsets. Such functionality can aid operators in mitigating plant shutdown severity and duration, if not prevent shutdown altogether due to its reporting of useful statistics, metrics, and diagnostics. Monitoring functionality is also limited, particularly for the remotely operated sites. This limitation results in response personnel having to travel to the sites to determine the nature of a problem when an alarm rings on the phone. With more reliable system communication and improved monitoring and control capability, an operator could remediate issues remotely.", "To enhance system functionality, staff recommends hiring the expertise of Vertech, a qualified industrial-process-control-integration consultant to undertake a holistic system survey and generate a SCADA Master Plan that is relevant to the present state of the City\u2019s Water and Wastewater control systems. Such a report would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the current state of the City\u2019s SCADA infrastructure and reveal gaps to overcome. Staff would then use this information to implement measures that enhance operation in accordance with present-day standards and available technology. Furthermore, staff would work with the consultant to develop SCADA standards for programming and developing graphical interfaces. Such an approach has been proven to be successful in other public agencies, such as the City of Guelph Water Services Department in Ontario, Canada which shows favorable results in reliability of automatic control schemes, ease of operating equipment from SCADA and troubleshooting automation problems, and efficiency in future automation development due to implementing SCADA standards. Integration of future City projects, such as the CBI and the SWIP, would be implemented in accordance with the established standards.

The goal reflects the community\u2019s recognition that education begins prior to kindergarten. In fact, one of Council\u2019s five strategic goals adopted in August 2015, Learn + Thrive, aligns with the decades of collaboration between the City, School District, College, non-profits, and residents to foster a lifelong learning community that thrives.", "The Council has also established a Child Care & Early Education Task Force that meets regularly to actively support quality programs and access for all economic groups. Childcare is the first \u201cstep\u201d in Santa Monica\u2019s Cradle to Career initiative to support healthy development and well-being for the City\u2019s youngest residents. According to Connections for Children (CFC), a regional childcare resource and referral agency that receives funding through the City\u2019s Human Services Grants Program to improve access to quality early care, there are always low and moderate-income families seeking subsidized childcare on their waitlist. Typically, about 60% of these families are in the 90404 area code. The number changes constantly, but at recent points in time, there have been between 50 and 60 families with 80-100 children on the list. This data does not include families seeking childcare that are able to pay full tuition. There are no statistics on these families, which may be either residents or those who work in the City and desire childcare near work. CCS staff reviewing the proposed project have also noted that the applicant has outlined an operating plan that offers a full-day program, acceptance of children in need of tuition assistance, and collaboration with Connections for Children to accept families who qualify for childcare subsidies. In this way, the proposed facility particularly caters to the strongest need in the childcare network for high quality programs that accept subsidies and lower income children as participants.", "Addressing Potential Use Conflicts through the CUP and Specific Use Standards", "During the 2015 Zoning Ordinance revision, the Council implemented LUCE Goal CE9 and Policy CE9.1 to integrate childcare uses into the neighborhoods, by adopting specific use standards for compatibility and fee incentives. The Council expanded the potential locations for childcare facilities to all neighborhoods, including R1 Zoning Districts, through the discretionary CUP process. Childcare facilities are among the very few non-residential uses permitted in single-family zoning districts. The CUP requirement and Specific Use Standards, outlined in SMMC Section 9.31.120, reflect the expectation that there are potential conflicts to be addressed when allowing a childcare use in a residential neighborhood. Potential issues include daily vehicle trips and parking, noise, and the appearance and changed use of a residential home with a non-residential use. The Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the application included conditions to address these issues, as discussed further below.", "Compliance with Childcare and Early Education Facilities Specific Use Standards", "The Zoning Ordinance Specific Use Standards were developed to address the particular characteristics, needs and potential impacts of childcare uses in order to facilitate development of high quality childcare while promoting compatibility with surrounding uses. In residential zones, through the CUP process, additional conditions can be included as appropriate to reflect the specific circumstances of the proposed facility in proximity to residential uses. The CUP conditions should protect neighborhood residents while ensuring that the facility is able to operate its educational and developmental program to provide high quality childcare and early education that meet the needs of working families.", "The proposed project is required to be consistent with specific standards regulating Childcare and Early Education Facilities (SMMC 9.31.120). These standards pertain to: allowing a four-foot front yard fence, or higher with approval of a modification, to enclose a play yard; providing a minimum amount of outdoor play area space in compliance with State licensing requirements; limiting outdoor activity hours; allowing the Director to approve one required passenger loading space on the street adjacent to the facility; requiring compliance with State and other licensing requirements; and designating a neighborhood liaison to address concerns during both construction and operation of the facility. Draft conditions #2, #6, #9, #12 and #13 incorporate the Code\u2019s operational requirements.", "The specific use standards that reflect the facility\u2019s physical design include providing sufficient indoor and outdoor space as required by State law, providing a passenger loading plan, and allowing higher front yard fences than typically allowed in residential zones to enclose a play yard. The proposal complies with the space requirements and the Mobility Division has reviewed and determined that the parking and passenger loading spaces shown on the site plan comply with the Code\u2019s dimension, access and visibility requirements.", "The Planning Commission approved a modification to allow the front yard fence up to five feet in height in order to facilitate the need for the fence to be four feet in height from the interior as required by State law due to the grade differential between the street and the property. The fence would be offset by 18\u201d from the existing two-foot retaining wall at the property line, with landscaping required to soften the interface with the sidewalk. The fence height would be considered to be five feet per SMMC 9.04.050.D (Measuring Fence, Wall and Hedge Height), which states that the height of a fence located within five feet of a public sidewalk is measured from the closest point on the sidewalk. The fence would run for 29 feet along the front property line from the southwest corner. It would then turn back for 18 feet and continue at the full five foot height to the east property line. Fencing in the rear and side yards is permitted to be up to eight feet.", "State requirements for childcare facilities specify that a fence must be designed to \u201ckeep children from leaving the outdoor activity area unnoticed but will not in and of itself present a hazard.\u201d Accordingly, a fence need not be solid, but must ensure that children are not able to climb over it (see Fence/Wall Modification, below). The Planning Commission\u2019s approval requires maximum transparency within these guidelines.", "Conditions for Special Events", "Quality childcare programs promote strong communications with the children\u2019s parents. The applicant plans to hold regular Family Forums, which may be held during or outside of operational hours. These meetings gather parents who are familiar with the site and the rules for neighborhood consideration, but it is important for neighbors to receive communications about them if they are planned outside of regular operational hours. Condition #1 requires notice to properties within a 300-foot radius of the property at least one week in advance in such cases.", "In addition, Condition #5 allows the PCD Director to approve up to two events annually based on the same findings required for Temporary Event Permits for activities related to the childcare but not specifically for the families, such as a fundraising event that is typical for non-profits. Notification would be required to neighbors within a 300-foot radius of the property. A request to hold the event must be submitted at least 45 days in advance. Although the applicant has stated that at this time, they do not anticipate doing these types of events, this condition sets forth appropriate limits and conditions to avoid disruption to the neighborhood should such an event be contemplated in the future.", "Transportation/Parking", "As described above, the applicant is providing the number of automobile and short-term bicycle parking spaces that the Code requires for this use. The Mobility Division has reviewed the parking dimensions and access and the proposed bike racks, determining that they are acceptable. Passenger loading is satisfied with one on-site space and a request (by variance) to substitute an on-street short-term parking space for the second loading space, which the Code allows the Director to approve on the street adjacent to the property. The main reason for requesting this substitution is to avoid passenger loading space standards that would negatively affect the neighborhood by changing the sidewalk and requiring removal of the street tree in front of the house.", "The childcare use would introduce new weekday traffic patterns on the street in that up to 20 children would be dropped off in the mornings and picked up in the evenings Mondays through Fridays. Although some may be siblings, and some may carpool, walk or bicycle, it is inevitable that the childcare facility will result in additional trips to the location.", "The peak morning drop-off time for the childcare facility would take place between 7:45 and 8:30 a.m. Parents are required by law to bring their children into the facility and sign them in, and to sign them out in the afternoon/evening when they pick them up.", "Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, staff heard from several neighbors who expressed frustration about increased traffic on Delaware Avenue since the Exposition Line became operational last year. Their input indicates that Delaware Avenue has become a popular cut-through street during morning and evening peak hours when traffic on Stewart Avenue tends to back up. Changes to traffic patterns that have occurred since opening the Expo Line are unrelated to the current request, but are considered as an existing condition in terms of analysis of this request.", "Neighbors sharing the alley with the property expressed concern about having their access blocked by parents\u2019 cars in the mornings. A project condition (#10) requiring a drop-off and pick-up plan was developed in order to help control the additional trips to the street and alley to access the childcare facility and avoid inconvenience to the neighboring residents at these times. The drop off and pick up plan, subject to the Mobility Division\u2019s approval prior to Certificate of Occupancy issuance, requires specific assignments to all parents to use either the street or the alley, with consideration to the anticipated arrival time of each family, in order to distribute trips. Parents would need to sign an agreement to drive and park in a manner that respects and avoids inconvenience to the neighborhood. The condition also requires all parents to sign a Drop-Off and Pick-Up Agreement, agreeing to abide by its terms.", "The total number of 20 children is small enough that there is capacity between the rear loading space, the front short-term space and other nearby street parking or on-site parking spaces for parents to safely park and sign in their children. Parents do not generally bring their children to daycare all at the same time, and bringing or retrieving a child generally takes no more than 10 minutes, although it could be more if parents need to speak with staff or settle in their children. At times that staff has visited the site and observed use of street parking, it appears that the two-hour parking restriction keeps employees of nearby businesses from parking on the street, leaving ample street parking for the short-term needs of parents coming to the childcare. Based on the above, staff concludes that the proposed plan for dropping off and picking up children from the center is feasible and through its implementation, disruption to the neighborhood can be substantially avoided.", "The applicant has stated that she intends to encourage alternatives to driving to the site, although the decisions that parents make are largely out of the applicant\u2019s control. The applicant can actively encourage employees to rideshare, which could make on-site parking spaces available to meet other needs.  Condition #15 requires rideshare encouragement including transit passes and encouraging bike commuting. Condition #17 also encourages the applicant to demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made to recruit qualified staff that reside within the 90404 zip code.", "Variance Analysis: Key Findings and Justification", "Approval of the proposed Variances requires that the City Council make all nine of the required Variance findings pursuant to SMMC Section 9.42.040.

The R1 parking standards are oriented toward compatibility of single-unit uses, which is the predominant use in the zoning district. While childcare facilities are conditionally permitted, the standards do not really consider the very different functioning of parking and loading for these uses as compared with single-unit homes. Enclosing the parking in a garage is not practical for this use, and it would necessitate a very large structure in order to meet ADA requirements, which are not applicable to single-unit homes. The childcare use must accommodate three parking spaces as well as at least one loading space on the property. Use of the front driveway in a similar manner to the previous residential use, which had a driveway that could be used for additional parking, meets the needs of the use. However, as a required space, it is not permitted, which is again a special circumstance occasioned by the proposed use. The last variance, to reduce one loading space and provide instead an on-street, short-term parking space, is also justified by the special circumstance of the childcare use, which is the only such use in the district that is allowed an on-street loading space. However, the Building Code requirements for passenger loading, as opposed to short-term parking, create a special circumstance because it would compel the applicant to modify the sidewalk and provide ADA-compliant ramps that would be incompatible with the neighborhood\u2019s character, particularly because they would require removal of a mature street tree. Granting this variance addresses the conflict caused by these requirements, given the special circumstances of the childcare use.", "Not Detrimental nor Injurious to Surroundings", "Finding 9.42.040(B) states the following:", "The granting of such variance will not be detrimental nor injurious to the property or improvements in the general vicinity and district in which the property is located.", "The project provides all required parking, and one passenger loading space on-site. The Director may approve a second passenger loading space for a childcare facility on the adjacent street, but a short-term street parking space is requested in place of the on-street loading space in order to avoid the need to make right-of-way modifications that would be inconsistent with the character of the residential neighborhood street. In making this finding, it should be considered that neighborhood residents typically park their cars on front driveways, although driveways are not considered their required parking. Designating the front driveway as one of the three required parking spaces for the use supports the childcare\u2019s activity while resulting in essentially the same use of the driveway as it served for the previous use as a residence and does not substantially alter the relationship of the property\u2019s access to the street. Concerning the reduction of one loading space, with substitution of a short-term parking space, the Code already allows the Director to approve one on-street loading space in front of a childcare. The short-term space would not be injurious to the surrounding improvements in the general vicinity because it would function similarly and thus meet the intent of the Code requirement, while avoiding the interruption of the consistent, residential streetscape and street tree pattern. Furthermore, the space will be available for general use outside of the facility\u2019s operating hours. Thus, this finding can be made for all three of the requested variances.", "Practical Difficulties or Unnecessary Hardships", "Finding 9.42.040(C) states the following:", "\u201cThe strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, not including economic difficulties or economic hardships.\u201d", "The strict application of the Code, requiring alley-accessed parking in a garage and prohibiting parking in the front yard setback area, would result in hardship for the childcare use, which is required to provide a total five parking and loading spaces rather than the usual two spaces needed in this district. The requirement for parking in a garage accessed from the alley, combined with ADA requirements that do not normally apply to single-family homes, would result in the need to develop a large three-car garage structure. Providing such a structure would then leave insufficient space along the 50-foot property width to provide the required refuse, recovery and recycling storage and an accessible passenger loading space. Additionally, the childcare facility might be forced to reduce the amount of play area and possibly the number of children served in order to meet all parking location and access requirements in the rear of the property in an enclosed structure.  Furthermore, the garage structure would increase lot coverage and be less compatible with the surrounding properties. Concerning the reduction of one loading space, with substitution of a short-term parking space, the Code\u2019s nomenclature that designates only a loading zone and not a short-term parking space option, would result in practical difficulties due to Building Code requirements to modify the sidewalk with ramps for ADA access that are not compatible with the single-unit residential area and not required for short-term parking. However, the short-term parking will provide equivalent service for the drop off and pick up of children at the childcare facility. Therefore, this finding can be made for all three of the requested variances.", "Unreasonable Deprivation of the Use or Enjoyment of the Property", "Finding 9.42.040(J) states the following:", "\u201cThe strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in unreasonable deprivation of the use or enjoyment of the property.\u201d", "The General Plan encourages childcare and the Zoning Code conditionally permits the use in this single-family zoning district, but requires more parking than a residential use, while still within an enclosed garage. These locational requirements reflect residential needs and character, but on a typical lot such as the subject property, the requirements taken together become unreasonable for the establishment of a childcare facility. Requiring the applicant to construct a three-car garage in the rear of the property, as well as providing an ADA-compliant loading space would preclude optimal siting to meet the needs of the childcare, which deprives the applicant of the property\u2019s use, including a potential reduction in play area and enrollment. Furthermore, due to the need for one space more than the typical single-family residential use in the R1 District, allowing the additional space to be located on the existing front driveway is necessary to allow the facility to serve 20 children, making it possible to develop a viable facility. In this way, the variances in combination provide relief from the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance to avoid unreasonable deprivation of the property\u2019s use for providing childcare to the community, a use that is conditionally permitted in the R1 District.", "Neighborhood Compatibility", "In terms of form and physical appearance, the Code\u2019s CUP findings require that a childcare facility have a physical design that is compatible and relates harmoniously to the surrounding neighborhood.", "The proposed facility will utilize a structure that has been part of this single-family neighborhood for 67 years, making only minor changes to the exterior in order to comply with building code exiting requirements. Demolishing the existing garage would change the property\u2019s appearance from the alley, but would have relatively little impact on the neighborhood\u2019s appearance since it is a secondary structure not visible from the street, and surrounding properties have high rear walls. The applicant is developing a landscaping plan that creates a garden setting, with emphasis on a natural appearance in the front yard. This type of landscaping design is typical in front yards in single-family neighborhoods throughout Santa Monica and compatible with this street.", "Placement of the required third parking space, discussed above, on the driveway (by variance) would be compatible with the pattern that exists on the street because it involves minor modification to the existing front driveway and follows the neighborhood pattern. It is typical in this neighborhood to park cars on the front driveway.", "The most atypical feature of the childcare facility in relation to the surrounding street is the front yard fence, which State law requires in order for the area to be utilized for outdoor play yard space. Due to the slope of the lot, the existing front yard is raised two feet above the sidewalk level, and is held back by a retaining wall. The five-foot fence that the Planning Commission approved by modification would require some excavation of the front yard so that the interior of the fence would be no less than four feet to comply with State law. The fence would run along 29 feet of the property line and would be set 18\u201d back from the existing front retaining wall. The setback space would be used to create a bench and landscaping that softens the effect that the fence will have on the street, which otherwise is mostly free of fences. As designed and conditioned, the fence maintains compatibility with the neighborhood to the greatest extent possible while meeting State requirements.", "Landscape Architect\u2019s rendering of proposed front fence and landscaping", "The fence/wall modification findings, as summarized at the beginning of this report, are made to assure that the increased height of the fence is compatible and necessary to mitigate impacts from adjacent land uses, and that it will not be detrimental to the property, neighboring properties and the overall integrity of the neighborhood. These findings can be made because the Specific Standards for Childcare and Early Education Facilities explicitly recognize the potential need for higher front yard fences to enclose play yards that are required to meet State standards for these uses, which justifies the need for the fence. The design as conditioned is sensitive to the surroundings and therefore the fence would not be detrimental to the surrounding uses and neighborhood.", "Condition #9 would require the Director to review the materials and style of the fence prior to issuance of building permits to ensure that it has the greatest possible transparency.

Although sounds of children playing at the childcare would be more consistent during the daytime than at a typical single-family home, the premises would be quiet at night and on the weekends. The noise potential from the normal patterns of children\u2019s play would not constitute the type of noise referred to above. Nevertheless, the conditions of approval specify compliance with the Noise Ordinance, and prohibit organized outdoor activities before 8:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. or after sunset, whichever comes first, consistent with SMMC Section 9.31.120.

The appeal analysis below responds to these six points to address all topics raised in the appeal narrative.", "The Council\u2019s hearing on the appeal is de novo, and as such, the Council may consider all aspects of the proposed project in rendering its decision, including the points of appeal, additional evidence presented by the applicant, appellant, staff and the public, and the draft findings and conditions.", "Appeal Analysis", "The following states and responds to each of the six points summarized above.", "#1: Strong Opposition by Entire Neighborhood:", "The appellant states that she speaks for the entire neighborhood, which the appeal refers to as the Gandara Park Neighborhood. She references a number of elderly neighbors and states: \u201cAll of them strongly oppose the proposed preschool.\u201d She also references families in the neighborhood with small children that are opposed and states: \u201cAll of us - regardless of race, ethnicity or socio-economic background - strongly oppose the Proposed Preschool\u2026\u201d", "Response: The public hearing process is structured to allow an applicant to propose an allowed use on a property that requires a discretionary permit, subject to compliance with specified Code standards and findings. As a conditionally permitted use, findings for compatibility test whether the application meets the intent of the Code section that allows its use, is consistent with the general plan, and is compatible with the neighborhood. Decision-makers and the public receive all information in a transparent manner. In this case, variances and a fence modification were also requested, requiring consideration of additional findings. In addition to staff\u2019s analysis, the hearing process provides opportunities to consider all points brought up by the applicant and any member of the public with an interest in the outcome of the decision. Often, there are both opponents and supporters of a project, as there were in this case, and all are given an opportunity to be heard, whether in writing prior to the hearing, in person at the hearing, or both.", "In this case, the appellant\u2019s opposition to the proposal and the testimony of many in the neighborhood objecting to the preschool were articulated both in writing and in person at the hearing. The Planning Commission was aware of this opposition when it made its decision. Weighing public testimony against other considerations of the project\u2019s merits and compliance with the Code and General Plan, as well as justification of the variances and fence modification, the Commissioners used their discretion and voted to approve the use.", "As a de novo hearing, the Council, like the Planning Commission, will hear all input, and will consider the statements of opposition together with the merits, findings and recommended conditions for approval. The Council must weigh the considerations of the application to provide a preschool on the applicant\u2019s property against the appellant\u2019s evidence of strong neighborhood opposition to this new use. The Council is often required to make difficult land use decisions and weighs all evidence before doing so. In terms of legal responsibility, the appellant\u2019s statement that all neighbors oppose the application does not necessitate the reversal of the Planning Commission\u2019s approval of the project.", "#2: New Traffic:", "The appellant states: \u201cTraffic and parking in Gandara Park Neighborhood have already reached unmanageable levels, with local businesses using this stretch of Delaware for parking for their employees and Waze designating our streets as cut-throughs to avoid traffic on the 10 freeway, Olympic, Exposition and Centinela. Introducing at least 50 new car trips during peak hours on our small residential street will push it over the tipping point.\u201d", "Response: A discussion of existing and anticipated traffic issues brought up by the appellants is provided below in response to #6. The 50 new car trips referenced is over the full day, not during each peak period, as the proposed childcare facility is estimated to introduce a maximum of 26 trips in the a.m. period and 26 in the p.m. period. These trips would be staggered, with employees arriving at different times based on schedule and children arriving in a controlled pattern based on assigned loading place and time. Unfortunately, the City does not have recent data on this street to compare this number to the current daily trip count.", "Staff does not have any evidence to confirm the claim that Delaware Avenue is used for parking by nearby businesses. However, the street does have preferential parking restrictions, and is limited to two-hour parking during the day. Staff\u2019s observations of the street during the daytime have indicated a great deal of available street parking.", "#3: Violates the LUCE:", "The appellant states: \u201cThe Proposed Preschool violates the LUCE, because it eliminates existing housing stock and allows for the encroachment of commercial uses into quiet residential neighborhoods.\u201d", "Response: The proposed preschool will utilize the existing house and adapt the interior for compliance with State requirements for early education facilities. As such, it does not eliminate existing housing stock, although it does change the use. While a preschool is a business, it is qualitatively different from typical commercial businesses. The Zoning Code includes Child Care and Early Education Facilities within the \u201cPublic and Semi-Public\u201d use classification, implying that its character is similar to a public use, such as a school. Preschools are conditionally permitted in the R1 zoning district while other commercial uses are not permitted. As such, approval of a preschool is not a harbinger of commercial encroachment. Furthermore, preschools have enrollment processes and admit a specific group of children who come regularly to the location. The use does not invite walk-in traffic or transient customers into the neighborhood.", "LUCE policies for the Pico Neighborhood focus on neighborhood character through maintenance of existing structures and adoption of development standards. (Policy N11.5, p. 2.2-27). This is consistent with the citywide land use policy (LU1.4, p. 2.1-11) of \u201cRetention of Existing Structures\u201d to conserve neighborhood character. The proposed project maintains the existing structure, which is currently vacant and in need of maintenance to become habitable again. By conserving the existing home, and using it to provide a community service for the Pico Neighborhood, the proposed project is consistent with the LUCE approach to neighborhood conservation. Support for the finding of General Plan consistency for this project is also discussed earlier in this report.", "#4: Area is Already Over-Preschooled", "The appeal cites a 2014 RAND Study that stated that Santa Monica has a surplus of preschool spaces for City residents. \u201cThere are already 46 preschools within 2 miles of the proposed preschool and 20 preschools and 15 existing daycares located within a mile or less from the site. A new preschool in a residential neighborhood that already has too many preschools does not make sense and is not good City planning\u201d (p. 2).", "Response: The RAND Study sought \u201cto provide the City and SMMUSD with the data and analysis required to deliver effective and sustainable early and school-age care programs\u2026\u201d (Rand Report, page 3, included in Attachment C) The report was based on 2011 data, and cited a population of approximately 3,600 children under the age of five. The most current available data on the US Census site (www.census.gov/quickfacts <http://www.census.gov/quickfacts>) for July 2016 estimates that this number has grown somewhat since this time to 4.1% of the population of 92,478, or 3,800 children under five years old.", "In noting a \u201csurplus of preschool places for city residents,\u201d the RAND study did not infer that there were too many preschools in Santa Monica, but rather that at that particular point in time, the available preschool age childcare facilities met resident needs and still had some room for nonresidents seeking childcare near their jobs in Santa Monica. The context of the statement in the RAND study was to note that high quality childcare is an important economic development tool in terms of attracting a skilled workforce. The report also contrasted the availability of preschool places with the City\u2019s lack of toddler places for ages 0-2 and suggested ways to improve access and participation as well as support development of high quality facilities.", "The significance of the two-mile radius noted in the appeal statement is unclear, as that distance encompasses most of Santa Monica and extends into the City of Los Angeles. According to State Community Care Licensing database (as of 10/12/17), there are 54 preschool centers (ages 2-5), 12 infant/toddler centers (0-2 years), 19 large family day care homes, and 11 small family day care homes in Santa Monica. Of the preschool centers, 18 are located in 90404. The two closest centers to the proposed preschool are located just south of the 10 Freeway on Virginia Avenue and Pico Boulevard.", "It is generally difficult to provide accurate estimates for total childcare need as there is no central mechanism that gathers this data for the entire community. Connections for Children (CFC), a regional child care resource and referral agency that is funded through the City\u2019s Human Services Grants Program to improve access to quality early care, keeps an eligibility waiting list of lower income families looking for subsidized childcare. This list changes constantly, even daily, reflecting family circumstances for parents and many other factors. Working families eligible for subsidy often have a hard time locating providers that will accept this subsidy and offer full-time care. Of those waiting to place children ages 0-5, generally about 60% reside in the 90404 zip code, according to CFC. The City\u2019s Human Services Division, which administers City programs in support of childcare and staffs the Childcare Task Force agrees that there is a clear need for more childcare centers, such as the proposed facility, that offer full-time slots and accept subsidies.", "Notwithstanding the above discussion of childcare supply and demand, establishing that a childcare facility is \u201cneeded\u201d in the City is not a criterion for its approval. While the City adopts general plan goals and zoning regulations, individual property owners, businesses and developers initiate projects and implement development on their properties within the framework of the regulations. In doing so, applicants indicate their assessment that there is demand for the service they propose to provide. The Zoning Code may incorporate incentives for desired uses and it may prohibit or limit less desired uses. The zoning process assumes that the market will generally balance supply and demand. If an application complies with Code requirements and the findings can be made in a positive manner, the demand or need for the use is not a review criterion unless the Code contains a quota for a particular use. There is no such limitation on childcare facilities.", "#5: Does Not Meet Mandatory CUP Findings:", "The appeal statement states that findings were not made to support the issuance of a CUP, and in one place, on page 19, states that findings were not provided to support the Variances. The appeal finds fault with the report, which focused on key variance findings and summarized CUP findings and did not further elaborate on other required findings. The statement claims that the Commission \u201cdid not perform its duty to properly investigate the valid ethical, moral and legal objections raised by Gandara Park Neighborhood residents to the Preschool.\u201d", "Response: The staff report narrative summarized the approach to analyzing the request in terms of the mandatory findings of fact and highlighted key issues for Commissioners to consider, including neighborhood compatibility. The narrative discussed issues of compatibility such as noise, trips and parking, the proposed fence, and site design matters. The staff report also included attachments with more detailed information and application materials, which are also considered an integral part of the staff report. Attachment B to the staff report, the draft Statement of Official Action (referred to as the STOA), contained language for making all findings for the CUP, variances, and modification in a positive manner for the Commission\u2019s consideration. By adopting those findings with small adjustments that were read into the record, the Commission performed its legal duty to make all findings required in the Zoning Code. The final signed STOA, reflecting the decisions made on September 6, 2017, was approved at a subsequent meeting on October 4, 2017 and accepted by the applicant (Attachment F).", "The appeal statement does not specify which findings the appellant believes were not made, but the narrative indicates particular disagreement with findings of neighborhood compatibility (CUP finding #5 and Variance finding #5). The appellant indicates that a childcare use located in one of the single-family homes on the street is fundamentally incompatible with the residential uses that occupy all other properties. The appellant states that \u201cthis tiny neighborhood cannot stand to lose its right to retain its strictly R1 zoning\u201d (Appeal, p. 6), and that \u201cthe Proposed Preschool cannot be designed, located and operated in a manner that will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of the surrounding properties as required by applicable law (p. 13). These statements, and other statements opposing the project made during the Planning Commission review process, appear to indicate the appellant\u2019s contention that any childcare facility in one of the homes on this street or within the neighborhood would be incompatible and would impair the integrity and character of the district.", "While the appellant asserts that a childcare facility is fundamentally incompatible in a R1 residential district, the Council has determined that childcare and early educational uses can be compatible in a R1 District when it revised the Zoning Ordinance in 2015 to allow the use through the CUP process, and established specific use standards. Once established as a conditionally permitted land use, the finding is properly made by examining the individual request and characteristics of the proposed site development and operations to ensure that it meets the standards and intent of the Code. In this particular case, the Planning Commission considered the proposed operation serving 20 children in the existing structure, with a drop-off/pick-up plan and restrictions on hours and outdoor play in the early morning along with other specific conditions of approval and found that, as conditioned, the proposed project meets all the findings of compatibility for the CUP, variance and modification.", "#6: The Planning Commission relied on inaccurate and unsubstantiated claims within the Report and did not perform its duty to properly investigate valid legal challenges and concerns raised by Gandara Park Neighborhood residents.", "The appellant claims that the report was deficient in the following way (p. 18 of appeal statement):", "\u00a7 The Report mischaracterizes the neighbors' knowledge of the Proposed Preschool before the August 20 informational meeting hosted by the Applicant. The Report also omits or minimizes the negative reactions of residents to the Proposed Preschool.", "o Response: The report provided information about neighborhood outreach efforts that the applicant documented in the application and about the neighborhood meeting at which staff was present.", "In terms of notification of this request prior to the August 20th meeting, staff can confirm that the application, submitted on May 18, 2017, included proof of the required site notice posted on the property, and staff received some phone calls around the time that it was posted. The hearing date was added on June 27, 2017. Although callers expressed concern and had questions, and concerns expressed at the August 20th meeting were noted in the staff report along with one letter of opposition that had been received, the level of vocal neighborhood concern increased significantly after the report was released and at the hearing. There was no intent to mischaracterize opposition to the proposal.", "\u00a7 The Report fails to provide any credible evidence for its purported justification for the school.", "o Response: Although the appellant clearly disagrees with the analysis in the staff report, the report does cover all relevant topics associated with analysis of potential impacts that may be attributable to the use. The report and findings, taken together, provided sufficient justification to support the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the application may be approved.", "\u00a7 The Report makes conclusory statements minimizing the impact of the Proposed Preschool on the traffic and safety of the neighborhood\u2026 Despite the obvious disruption that this business will bring to the neighborhood, the Report casually dismisses those disruptions and concludes - without any evidentiary support and often by relying on the \u201cevidence\u201d provided by the Applicant - that the disruptions will be minimal to neighborhood or solved by the \u201csolutions\u201d suggested in the Report\u2026", "o Response: Staff analysis focused on this project\u2019s potential trip generation and its effects on the neighborhood and does not either minimize or inflate the expected trips to the street from up to 20 children being dropped off and picked up five days a week, and up to six staff arriving as scheduled. The project provides the Code-required number of parking and loading (or short-term) spaces, and the conditions of approval require transit subsidies and encouragement of non-driving alternatives. Because the use is not residential, childcare staff will not be eligible for permit parking placards, so staff will not be able to use street parking for more than two hours. Street parking by parents will be for short periods that will not impact the parking supply for the neighborhood because in the mornings the neighborhood residents will be parked first and in the evenings, if loading spaces are taken, parents will use street parking for short stays only. After 6:00pm and on weekends, there will be no change from the present conditions on the street.", "To address neighborhood concerns and distribute these trips, a drop-off and pick-up plan is required as a condition of approval. With optimal utilization of front and rear loading spaces, considering the facility\u2019s maximum enrollment of 20 children, adhering to this plan can ensure that trips to the childcare avoid overwhelming the street and alley. Parents will have specific assignments and will sign binding agreements as a condition for sending the children to Untitled #1.", "\u00a7 The Report completely ignores the already impacted condition of the neighborhood \u2026 and (fails) to even mention the Traffic Plan implemented in the past by the City to keep traffic out of our R1 neighborhood.", "o Response: Staff analysis does not minimize or ignore resident concerns regarding cut-through traffic in the neighborhood. The Traffic Engineering Division has not yet studied these impacts and thus no data exists to substantiate the claims of cars using the street in the mornings and evenings that did not exist prior to the Expo Line.", "The appeal cites large projects in the pipeline in the area north of Exposition Boulevard (the Bergamot Area Plan area) as another justification to deny the preschool and states that the approval did not consider these projects. Staff disagrees that current traffic and anticipated traffic that may be generated by new commercial projects north of this neighborhood are factors for consideration in this application, which is a small-scale reuse of an existing building that is categorically exempt from CEQA and thus does not require a traffic study.", "The City\u2019s Traffic Engineering Division has confirmed that it does not have a \u201cTraffic Plan\u201d for this neighborhood. Traffic-calming measures referenced by the appellant were implemented as part of the 2004 Lantana Development Agreements, including bulb-outs and turning restriction signs that were installed in 2008. However, the Expo Line extension project did not introduce new traffic measures. At this time, further study or development of a Traffic Plan in this neighborhood is not in the division\u2019s approved budget and work plan.", "\u00a7 The Report concludes, without any evidentiary support, that the significant increase in noise from this business will not impact the neighborhood. However, a large percentage of the residents on Delaware are elderly retirees who will be home during day when this business is operating. All our elders oppose the Proposed Preschool. Our elders crave and cherish what calmness and tranquility remains in our neighborhood after years of watching new developments spring up around their home.", "o Response: The appellant does not substantiate claims that elderly residents will suffer from the sounds of children playing. The Commission staff report did state that the sound of children playing is not incompatible in a residential area, and staff reaffirms this analysis because residential neighborhoods are places for children to live, gather and play. At the Planning Commission hearing, there were seniors who voiced concern about the potential noise from children\u2019s play, and the approval is conditioned to require compliance with the Noise Ordinance, and more importantly, for the applicant to maintain a Good Neighbor policy with a contact person to address any nuisance of which they are made aware.", "Many of these same concerns were included in a 21-page letter emailed on the evening of September 5, 2017, to the Planning Commissioners and staff. Although the timing precluded inclusion of the letter\u2019s points in the Planning Commission staff report, which had already been released, Commissioners received the information and thus were able to review that information as part of their deliberations. If the Commissioners had determined that the information presented in the letter warranted additional investigation, the hearing could have been continued with direction to staff. The Commission chose not to take up appellant\u2019s suggestion to conduct further study and declined to delay their action.", "In conclusion, the Planning Commission and the public received full information about the application, the Zoning Code and General Plan, the conditions proposed to ensure compatibility between the use and surrounding neighborhood and the public hearing. Neighborhood opposition and community support were expressed using the transparent public hearing structure and a decision was made. The appellant, representing a large group in the neighborhood, has expressed ongoing opposition to allowing this type of use in an R1 neighborhood, and the above discussion has responded to the specific points, concluding with staff\u2019s recommendation to approve the application, upholding the Commission\u2019s decision.", "Community Outreach and Comments", "In the application materials, the applicant provided documentation of her communications with neighbors about proposing a new childcare center prior to purchasing the property and submitting the application (see Attachment D).", "Soon after the site was posted for the Planning Commission hearing, staff received three phone calls from neighbors expressing concerns that the proposed center would lead to loss of residential stock in this relatively small neighborhood and increase car trips on Delaware Avenue. These neighbors noted that since the establishment of the Expo Line and delays on Stewart Street when the gates close to allow trains to pass, Delaware Avenue has experienced increased cut-through traffic at certain times of day. Callers expressed concern that the facility would add trips to the street\u2019s current traffic flow at times that they stated are already becoming problematic.", "On the afternoon of August 20, 2017, the applicant, Laila Taslimi, held a neighborhood meeting at the subject site attended by 29 neighbors, as well as her design team and the co-chair of the Childcare Task Force. City staff was also present and answered technical questions about the application and hearing process. At the meeting, Ms. Taslimi and her team provided details of the site, building and operational plans and then opened the meeting to questions and comments. Ms. Taslimi explained her plan to open the center as a registered non-profit organization next year with 12 children of mixed economic backgrounds, expanding gradually to reach the maximum of 20 children.", "Meeting participants, some of whom had previously spoken with staff as discussed above, brought up several concerns about the proposed childcare facility. Some stated that they oppose the use entirely and are concerned that it would set a precedent for the replacement of single-family homes with business uses. They were concerned about neighborhood traffic and additional use of the street in the mornings and evenings. Some cited recent increasing crime, and stated that bringing the families of children served by the use would introduce more people to become familiar with the neighborhood, which may lead to more crime on their quiet street. Furthermore, they expressed that they were not favorable toward the applicant\u2019s plans to take small groups of children to Ishihara Park, which they viewed as belonging to the nearby residents. The applicant and others present noted that Ishihara Park is a public park and not highly utilized on weekdays.", "Other neighborhood participants at the meeting expressed support for having this childcare in the neighborhood to meet the needs of working parents and create a sense of community through the concept of a preschool based on economic integration and pluralistic education.", "To reduce the impact on morning and evening traffic volumes, the applicant suggested at the meeting that it would be reasonable and feasible to assign parents to specific drop-off/pick-up locations, balancing use of the front and back parking spaces. She stated that employees would park in the three on-site spaces and that she planned to provide transit passes to those who would commute by transit rather than drive.

The LUCE identifies retention of the existing single-unit housing stock and design standards that allow for compatible development as important tools that promote the long-term stability of existing R1 neighborhoods. As stated in Policy LU1.1, the protection of neighborhoods is part of a balanced land use strategy that redirects investment pressure away from existing neighborhoods by providing opportunities for housing production and local-serving uses on commercial boulevards and transit-adjacent areas. Policies LU1.2 and N4.1 also call for establishing conservation strategies that manage and control the scale, type, rate, and compatibility of change occurring in existing neighborhoods. Reducing the development potential, as proposed by this interim ordinance, may discourage land speculation.", "Drawing from the policy framework set forth in the LUCE, a key purpose of the R1 zoning district is to ensure that the scale and design of new development and alterations to existing structures are consistent with the scale, mass, and character of the existing residential neighborhood. Recent trends in permit activity in R1 neighborhoods show that new home construction is often double or triple the size of existing homes, resulting in substantial changes in the existing character of R1 neighborhoods.", "As part of Council\u2019s discussion on City Planning Division priorities, on January 9, 2018, City Council directed staff to bring back interim zoning standards in the R1 zoning district that would temporarily reduce the size and scale of new single unit dwelling construction in order to ensure the character of existing R1 neighborhoods is preserved. Council specifically directed staff to consider reducing maximum parcel coverage by 20%, limiting maximum building height to 25 feet, and excluding accessory dwelling units from parcel coverage calculations. Staff has considered the Council direction, the public input received, and completed their own analysis. In keeping with the Council\u2019s interest to reduce the size of new single unit dwellings and for consistency in implementation of the interim standards, staff has added associated changes to upper level stepback requirements.", "Background", "As part of Council\u2019s discussion on City Planning Division priorities, Council determined that a revision to the R1 standards was of high importance. Council directed staff to prepare an interim ordinance that would temporarily reduce the size and scale of new homes pending a public process to study revisions to the R1 zone development standards.", "In addition to the input at the January 9, 2018 City Council meeting, staff has received numerous inquiries from concerned community members regarding the size of new home construction and the redevelopment of older housing stock. There is overall concern that the sizes of new single-unit dwellings are changing the character of existing R1 neighborhoods. On October 5, 2016, in response to public correspondence and testimony, the Planning Commission held a discussion about the rapid change occurring in the R1 zoning district citywide. At the time, the Commission had previously reviewed Variances for homes 9,000-11,000 square feet in size. On December 1, 2016, the Planning Commission submitted a letter to the City Council requesting that Council direct staff to prepare a comprehensive review of citywide R1 zoning standards.

In a comparison of new home size compared to existing homes over the past three years, staff found that new homes have been approximately two to three times larger than existing homes (while 2013-2014 data is available for average existing home size, due to time limitations in preparing this staff report, staff was only able to compile 2015-2017 data). In looking at demolition data over the past three years, the City has received approximately 70 applications per year.

The County rates are the maximum allowable ambulance rates chargeable to the general public. Thus, while there is an established methodology for increasing rates that takes into account some wage changes, these factors do not include the higher Santa Monica living wage.Additionally, revenue collected by ambulance companies is dependent on the insurance payer mix of the patients transported. Payer mix varies from community to community, and in Santa Monica, approximately one third of payers are Medicare and another third MediCal recipients. These payers pay considerably less to the ambulance company than what is billed.

Currently, water meters throughout the city are manually read once every two months. This infrequent and staff intensive process provides very limited data regarding actual water use patterns at individual sites and throughout the city. The real-time continuous data provided by AMI allows for the timely identification of leaks and excessive water use, allows customers to accurately budget their water use in order to meet conservation goals, provides more accurate water billing, and can help to improve customer service. In March of 2016 the City partnered with Southern California Gas Company (SCG) and Aclara Technologies (Aclara) to run a proof of concept AMI pilot. The pilot involved retrofitting some 200 City water meters (single family, multi-family, commercial) and using SCG\u2019s network infrastructure to transmit the meter reading data to a network management database and software hosted by Aclara. Subsequently, an additional 500 meters (roughly all City of Santa Monica municipal accounts and some locations that were challenging for City crews to perform manual meter reads for billing) were retrofitted with AMI technology. The pilot will run until March 2018.", "Preliminary indications are that 99.2% of the hourly data transmitted from the meter to the Data Management System has been received without error; the outlier may have been signal interference at one of the SCG\u2019s data collection units. During the pilot active response to anomalies in the data received (high consumption alerts) have allowed customers to be notified of potential leaks in time to reduce significant water loss. The continuation of the pilot will address the effectiveness of those services with both smart meters and a consumer engagement overlay called WaterSmart, which helps customers manage their water usage and assists the City to comply with State mandates. The full findings of the AMI pilot will be presented to Council in 2018 along with recommendations for possible expansion of the AMI system to all Santa Monica customers.", "Summary of Next Steps", "As previously noted in this report, staff initiated a comprehensive update of the Sustainable Water Master Plan (SWMP) earlier this year.
